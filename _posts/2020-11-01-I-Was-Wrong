#I Was Wrong

Everyone is afraid to be wrong. Being wrong hurts. It sucks.

Some common phrases spawned by this aversion:
- "Sorry if this is wrong"
- "Correct me if I am wrong"
- "This is probably wrong"
- "This could totally be wrong"

Also pretending to understand a topic you clearly do not. We are so afraid to be incorrect, we will go through a conversation pretending to understand things instead of asking for clarification. All because we are afraid to admit we do not know..
