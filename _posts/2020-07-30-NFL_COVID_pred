# NFL Covid Prediction

What will the upcoming 2020 NFL season look like?

I will present current Covid-19 data from the NFL and work out what I think this season will look like based on these numbers.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a virologist, medical doctor, epidemiologist, or any other expert in the realm of this infectious disease.
I am not taking a political stance (though I would like to).
I am not advocating for or against the occurence of an NFL season in 2020.
These are just the ramblings of a procrastinator that wants some thoughts recorded to revisit in six months to see what I got right.

I address a few main questions:
- How will Covid-19 affect the quality of NFL games?
- Whats the likelihood of all 256 games being played?


How will Covid-19 affect the quality of NFL games?
Overall, I predict Covid-19 will cause starters to miss games in every single NFL game this year.

- Opt outs
- test results for first wave of testing
- test results from Texans / Chiefs, a reason to be optomistic?


Whats the likelihood of all 256 games being played?
- how many players must be sick to cancel a game
- how hard is it to reschedule a cancelled NFL game?
- how many coaches must be sick to cancel a game?
- how bad must the situation be in the US to cancel the season?
