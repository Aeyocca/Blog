# NFL Covid Prediction

What will the upcoming 2020 NFL season look like?

I will present current Covid-19 data from the NFL and work out what I think this season will look like based on these numbers.

DISCLAIMER: I am not a virologist, medical doctor, epidemiologist, or any other expert in the realm of this infectious disease.
I am not taking a political stance (though I would like to).
I am not advocating for or against the occurence of an NFL season in 2020.
These are just the ramblings of a procrastinator that wants some thoughts recorded to revisit in six months to see what I got right.

I address a few main questions:
- How will Covid-19 affect the quality of NFL games?
- Whats the likelihood of all 256 games being played?


How will Covid-19 affect the quality of NFL games?
Overall, I predict Covid-19 will cause starters to miss games in every single NFL game this year.

- Opt outs

32

- test results for first wave of testing

As of 07-30-2020 there are 69 players on the reserve/Covid-19 list

The virus will likely spread within teams. Therefore, it is improper to extrapolate these on a per team basis. Extrapolation will conservatively estimate a worst case scenario so I am comfortable doing so.

I will assume these numbers will be steady throughout the season, again being conservative. Every team will miss 2-3 players per game due to Covid-19.

Compare this to Football Outsider's Adjusted Games Lost (AGL) metric for perspective. Teams averaged 75 AGL in the 2019 season. If every team loses 2-3 players per game, they will add over 30 AGL to this metric. Imagine a 50% increase in the injury rate of your favorite team. Now imagine this affecting the entire roster instead of the occasional special teams contributor.

Any football fan can imagine what life is like without their starting quarterback (*cough* Steelers, Jets, Panthers *cough*). Whats the probability a starting QB misses a game due to Covid-19? As the virus take about two weeks to pass, an infected QB is likely to miss two games at least.

Lets say each team has a static 53 man roster, resulting in 1696 players. If 70 have the virus at any given week (assuming each player gets counted twice before coming off the list), I project 595 players to have contracted Covid-19 be the end of the season. Wow. I didn't calculate this number until just now. That's pretty bleak. The probability at least one QB will contract Covid-19 is the complement of the probability no QB contracts Covid-19.

- test results from Texans / Chiefs, a reason to be optomistic?


Whats the likelihood of all 256 games being played?
- how many players must be sick to cancel a game
- how hard is it to reschedule a cancelled NFL game?
- how many coaches must be sick to cancel a game?
- how bad must the situation be in the US to cancel the season?
